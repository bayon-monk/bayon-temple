## About This Edition

**Version 1.X** — January 2026
Published by Bayon Temple Press

This is not a finished product. The version number reflects the book's philosophy: living frameworks evolve through contact with reality. All versions are 1.X because permanence is illusion.

The book was developed through sustained dialogue between human author Gerhard Diedericks and an AI Council (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, Qwen, and DeepSeek), each contributing as conversational partners and reviewers.

## Accessing the Content

All markdown files are plain text and can be:
- Read directly in any text editor
- Viewed on GitHub with proper formatting
- Converted to other formats (PDF, EPUB, etc.)
- Indexed and searched
- Used for personal learning and discussion
