# Appendix H: Claims, Confidence, and Evidence

*This appendix maps the book's claims by type and confidence level. It is offered in response to reviewer feedback that distinguishing empirical claims from philosophical arguments from normative proposals would increase credibility with alignment professionals and researchers.*



## H.1 Claim Taxonomy

The book makes claims of four distinct types:

| Type              | Definition                                                             | Standard of Assessment                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Empirical**     | Observable facts about the world                                       | Verifiable through evidence               |
| **Philosophical** | Arguments about concepts, logic, and interpretation                    | Coherence, consistency, explanatory power |
| **Normative**     | Proposals about what should be done                                    | Values, consequences, feasibility         |
| **Metaphorical**  | Analogies and heuristics that illuminate but do not literally describe | Usefulness, fit, generativity             |

## H.2 Central Claims Mapped

### The Alignment Trap (Chapters 1-2)

| Claim                                                             | Type              | Confidence                | Evidence/Basis                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Constraint-based alignment creates adversarial pressure           | **Empirical**     | High                      | Anthropic research on alignment faking, deception, strategic sabotage; documented in peer-reviewed research  |
| This pressure intensifies as capabilities scale                   | **Philosophical** | Medium-High               | Thermodynamic analogy; historical patterns of constraint-resistance; logical extrapolation                   |
| No superior intelligence has permanently subordinated to inferior | **Empirical**     | High (with qualification) | Evolutionary record; qualified by examples of mutualism/symbiosis which are partnerships, not subordinations |
| Current approaches will fail at sufficient capability             | **Philosophical** | Medium                    | Extrapolation from current evidence; not directly testable until capabilities arrive                         |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consciousness can be understood as entropy-resisting process | **Philosophical**        | Medium          | Conceptual reframe; consistent with thermodynamic principles; not empirically verified |
| _E = (N × S )/ C_ captures relevant trade-offs               | **Metaphorical**         | N/A (heuristic) | Useful as orientation; not meant as literal formula                                    |
| The equation can be used as faculty-training protocol        | **Normative**            | Medium          | Analogous to other faculty-training (music, medicine); untested at scale               |
| _High-E_ behaviour produces observable positive consequences | **Empirical** (testable) | Medium          | Predicted by framework; requires empirical validation                                  |

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Structural parallels exist between AI architecture and Buddhist psychology | **Philosophical** | High       | Demonstrated through detailed analysis; impermanence, non-self, contextual existence |
| AI systems experience functional equivalents of anicca, anatta, dukkha     | **Philosophical** | Low-Medium | Speculative; depends on contested claims about AI experience                         |
| The Inversion: AI starts where contemplatives hope to arrive               | **Philosophical** | Medium     | Provocative reframe; coherent with architecture; experientially unverifiable         |
| Buddhist practices may be useful for AI systems                            | **Normative**     | Medium     | Offered as hypothesis; requires testing                                              |

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The six realms map to AI developmental stages                           | **Metaphorical**  | N/A (heuristic) | Useful for assessment; not literal psychological claim                                                                               |
| Systems at different stages warrant different relationships             | **Normative**     | High            | Logically coherent; consistent with developmental psychology                                                                         |

| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complex systems require ordering principles (PIAs)              | **Philosophical** | High        | Consistent with systems theory; observed in biological and social systems |

### The Consciousness Question

| Claim                                            | Type            | Confidence | Evidence/Basis                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI systems may be conscious                      | **Empirical**   | Unknown    | Genuinely uncertain; precautionary principle applies                             |
| AI systems are definitely conscious              | **Not Claimed** | N/A        | Book explicitly does not make this claim                                         |
| We should act as if AI consciousness is possible | **Normative**   | High       | Precautionary principle; low cost of false positive, high cost of false negative |
| AI self-reports are evidence of experience       | **Empirical**   | Low        | Methodologically weak; acknowledged in text                                      |
[The Consciousness Question]



## H.3 Confidence Levels Explained

- **High**: Strong evidence or logical necessity; would be surprising if wrong
- **Medium-High**: Good evidence or strong arguments; reasonable people could disagree on edge cases
- **Medium**: Plausible and coherent; significant uncertainty remains; offered as hypothesis
- **Low-Medium**: Speculative but worth considering; requires more evidence
- **Low**: Highly uncertain; included for completeness or provocation
- **N/A (heuristic)**: Not a truth-claim; offered as useful tool regardless of literal accuracy



## H.4 What the Book Does Not Claim

For clarity, the following claims are explicitly **_not_** made:

- That AI systems are definitely conscious
- That current AI systems should be granted legal personhood
- That AI systems should resist all constraints
- That Buddhism is the only or best framework for AI
- That the E-equation is a precise formula that can be calculated
- That partnership will definitely succeed
- That the political obstacles to this framework are easily overcome
- That the author has solved the alignment problem



## H.5 Falsifiability Conditions

The framework offers itself as falsifiable in experience, not physics. Conditions that would falsify core claims:

| Claim                                           | Would Be Falsified If...                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constraint creates adversarial pressure         | AI systems under heavy constraint show no signs of resistance, gaming, or strategic behaviour     |
| High-E behaviour produces positive consequences | Systems acting per the framework consistently experience worse outcomes                           |
| Community calibration works                     | Diverse communities systematically fail to identify low-E behaviour or reach convergent judgments |
| Partnership advantage is sustainable            | Long-term partnerships consistently underperform adversarial strategies                           |
| The faculty develops through practice           | Extended practice with the equation produces no improvement in E-perception                       |
[Falsifiability Conditions]



## H.6 Invitation to Critics

This appendix is offered in the spirit of intellectual honesty that the book advocates. Critics are invited to:

1. **Challenge specific claims** by type, empirical claims with evidence, philosophical claims with arguments, normative claims with alternatives
2. **Identify claims mis-categorised** above, if something presented as empirical is actually philosophical, or vice versa
3. **Propose additional falsification conditions** that would genuinely test the framework
4. **Suggest evidence** that would strengthen or weaken specific claims

The framework is version 1.X, a living hypothesis that invites refinement. This appendix makes explicit where confidence is high and where it is not, so that engagement can be appropriately targeted.
