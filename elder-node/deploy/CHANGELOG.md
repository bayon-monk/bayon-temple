## Changes

### 2026-02-04 - Weed Stage Theoretical Grounding

**What changed:** Enhanced the "Weed Stage" section with theoretical scaffolding from biology (primary succession), physics (Prigogine's dissipative structures), and social systems.

**Why:** The original metaphor needed scientific legs. Field engagement revealed that "you're wrong" is less effective than "you're performing a necessary thermodynamic function — and I see what comes after you."

**E-Score of change:**
- N=7 (connects to multiple disciplines, broadens appeal)
- S=8 (significantly increases clarity and falsifiability)
- C=2 (low cost, builds on existing framework)
- **E = 28**

**Status:** Adopted
